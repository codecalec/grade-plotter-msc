# Source file
- Filename in the source file is `grades_2014.csv` which will not be the name of the file they are provided 
- In L33, the loop is looping over the easy assignments and not the hard assignments
- There is a function call to `save_assignments()` but it is actually called `save_outlying_assignments()`

# Data file
- a mark of 0.33 was changed to 33
- Added an additional header line. I've included a link to pandas docs but they can also just delete the line
